DNA is build of two twisted strands of nucleobases: (A)deine, (T)hymine, (G)uaine and (C)ytoine. These sequences are
complimentary in the way that Adeine is always paired with Thymine, and Guaine with Cytoine:

A -- T
G -- C

This way single DNA strand can be used as a template to construct the other.

Given is DnaLab class where some experiments can be run on DNA sequences. Implement method #canBeComplimentary where
argument is an array of strand fragments. The method should return true only and only when it is possible to form
complimentary dna strand out of these fragments.
